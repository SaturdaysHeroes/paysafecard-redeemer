### Paysafecard Redeemer 
This project was started as a way to programmatically redeem PaySafeCard codes without the need for using external payment gateways charging a very high processing fee. 

Puppeteer is used for the login and redeeming of codes. Sadly, due to the fact that page elements were dynamically renamed the project was never completed.
